# This program calculates the pay based on hours worked and rate per hour, including overtime pay for hours worked over 40. Applying the defined function computepay to calculate the total pay based on the input hours and rate.

def computepay(h, r):
    if h > 40:
        return 40 * r + (h - 40) * 1.5 * r
    else:
        return h * r

hrs = input("Enter Hours: ")
rate = input("Enter Rate: ")
h = float(hrs)
r = float(rate)
p = computepay(h, r)
